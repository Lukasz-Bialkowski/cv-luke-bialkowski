I created two versions of the same applications - one monolith and the other in currently favored microservice-based way. The later was tested on multiple machines, each having separate conserns and separate microservice. It all was connected and implemented with Sprint Cloud Suite. Series of tests improved my thesis that its sometimes not worth to use microservice approach. For further info please contact me. I would exaplain my experiments with pleasure.",
